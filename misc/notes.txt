## Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration

    ● Analyze and clean the dataset. Ensure that all images are appropriately processed (e.g.,
    resizing, normalization) for training.

    ● Perform data augmentation (e.g., flips, rotations, noise) to increase the robustness of
    your model.
    
    ● Visualize the distribution of images with and without watermarks and analyze any
    challenges such as class imbalance.

## Step 2: Model Selection & Training
    ● Build a machine learning or deep learning model that can detect the presence of
    watermarks in images.

    ● You can use object detection models (e.g., Faster R-CNN, YOLO) if working with
    bounding box annotations, or segmentation models (e.g., U-Net) for pixel-level
    detection.

    ● Train the model and evaluate its performance using appropriate metrics such as
    precision, recall, F1-score, and Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for location accuracy.

    ● Document your process for hyperparameter tuning and the rationale behind model
    architecture selection.

## Step 3: Model Deployment
    ● Deploy the trained model as a REST API using Flask or FastAPI.

    ● The API should accept an image as input and return whether a watermark is detected
    and, if so, its location in the form of bounding boxes or a heatmap overlay.

    ● Containerize the application using Docker.

## Step 4: Kubernetes Deployment
    ● Provide a Dockerfile to containerize the model and API.

    ● Include Kubernetes YAML manifests (Deployment, Service, etc.) for deploying the
    container to a Kubernetes cluster.
    
    ● While you don't need to deploy the application on a Kubernetes cluster for the
    take-home test, ensure that your instructions and deployment files are
    production-ready.
